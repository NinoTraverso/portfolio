      "After studying Astronomy for 4 years at university and successfully completed an Astronomy Research Internship I decided to create a website to blend my Web Development skills with my Astronomy knowledge. From information on our Solar System, a multi-functional glossary, insighftul and up-to-date articles (which I personally write with no use of AI) and an exoplanets listing using NASA's API with an ID search tool I plan to slowly add more features and perfect existing ones. With time, as it is my hobby, will be to slowly implement new features for a better user experience who, like me, has a passion for Astronomy.",
